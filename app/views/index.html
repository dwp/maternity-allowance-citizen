<p class="govuk-body">Maternity Allowance is a payment you can get when you take time off to have a baby.</p>

  <li>are employed but cannot get Statutory Maternity Pay (SMP)</li>
  <li>are self-employed</li>
  <li>have recently stopped working</li>
  <li>take part in unpaid work for the business of your spouse or civil partner</li>
</ul>


<p class="govuk-body">You can get Maternity Allowance for up to 39 weeks.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Before you start</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">You will also need to upload evidence of:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>Your maternity certificate (MAT B1)</li>
  <li>an SMP1 form from each employer you had during the 15th week before the week your baby is due</li>
  <li>Your baby's birth certificate, if relevant</li>

</ul>

<p class="govuk-body">You will need to know your National Insurance number.</p>

<p>You will not be able to save your claim. </p>

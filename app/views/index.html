  <li>are self-employed</li>
  <li>have recently stopped working</li>
  <li>take part in unpaid work for the business of your spouse or civil partner</li>
</ul>


<p class="govuk-body">You can get Maternity Allowance for up to 39 weeks and can claim after the 26th week of the pregnancy.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">If you delay sending your claim</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">If you claim later than 3 months after you want you Maternity Allowance to start, you may not get the full amount of Maternity Allowance.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Before you start</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">You will also need to upload evidence of:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>your maternity certificate (MAT B1)</li>
  <li>an SMP1 form from each employer you had during the 15th week before the week your baby is due</li>
  <li>Your baby's birth certificate, if relevant</li>

</ul>

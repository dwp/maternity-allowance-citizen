<h2 class="govuk-heading-xl">Effects on other benefits</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">The other benefits that can be affected are:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>bereavement benefits, for example Bereavement Support Payment</li>
  <li>Carer's Allowance</li>
  <li>Carer Support Payment (Scotland only)</li>
  <li>Employment and Support Allowance (ESA)</li>
  <li>Income Support</li>
  <li>Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA) - this will stop if you get Maternity Allowance</li>

</ul>

<p class="govuk-body">You can use the <a href="">benefit calculator (opens in a new tab)</a> to help find out what benefits you could get, how much you could get and how to claim.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">If you’re claiming ESA or Income Support, you may also get <a href="">Sure Start Maternity Grant (SSMG) (opens in new tab)</a>. This helps with the costs of having a baby if you live in England or Wales and you or your partner are on a qualifying benefit and do not have another child under the age of 16 living in the same household.</p>

<!--
<h1 class="govuk-heading-l">If you get Universal Credit</h1>
<p class="govuk-body">Your Universal Credit payment will be reduced by an amount equal to your Maternity Allowance payment. </p>
<p class="govuk-body">You may get an <a href="">extra amount of Universal Credit for your children</a> (whether you get Maternity Allowance of not).</p>
<p class="govuk-body"><a href="">Report a change on your Universal Credit account</a> if you start getting Maternity Allowance.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">What benefits you get will affect which <a href="">National Insurance credits</a> you're slegible for. If you get Universal Credit:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>with Maternity Allowance payments you get Class 1 National Insurance credits, which help you qualify for some other benefits and State Pension</li>
  <li>without Maternity Allowance payments, you get Class 3 National Insurance credits, which count towards your State Pension only.</li>

</ul>
-->

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Payments</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">	
  Most benefits are paid every 2 or 4 weeks. If you’re getting any other benefits and Maternity Allowance, these may fall on different days.</p>

  <!--<p class="govuk-body">You can use the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/maternity-paternity-calculator" target="_blank">benefit calculator (opens in new tab)</a> to help find out what benefits you could get, how much you could get and how to claim.</p>-->



<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">If you’re employed on pregnancy-related sick leave</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">If you’re getting Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) on or after the 4th week before the week the baby is due, this will stop.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">If you’re getting New Style Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) or Incapacity Benefit in this 4-week period, this may stop.</p>
